### API Integration
The application uses the OpenAI SDK through direct REST API calls:
- ChatGPT Pro: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
  - Supports multimodal input (text + images) via base64 encoding
  - Model: `chatgpt-4o-latest`
- SORA Video Generation: `https://api.openai.com/v1/videos` (POST)
- SORA Status Check: `https://api.openai.com/v1/videos/{video_id}` (GET)
- SORA Video Content: `https://api.openai.com/v1/videos/{video_id}/content` (GET)

#### Video Generation Flow
1. Submit video generation request
2. Receive job ID with status "queued"
3. Poll status endpoint every 5 seconds (max 60 attempts)
4. When status becomes "completed", retrieve video content from `/content` endpoint
5. Display video using blob URL

## Troubleshooting

### "API request failed"
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check that you have access to ChatGPT Pro and SORA models
- Ensure your API key has sufficient credits
- SORA API may require beta enrollment or special access
- For vision features, ensure your API plan supports multimodal inputs

### Video not displaying
- **Video generation is asynchronous**: The app will automatically poll for completion (up to 5 minutes)
- Watch the loading indicator for status updates during generation
- SORA API may require special access or beta enrollment
- Check the [OpenAI Video Generation Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/video-generation) for the latest details
- Verify the response format matches the expected structure
- Ensure your API key has access to video generation features

### CORS errors
- Use a local web server instead of opening the file directly
- Consider implementing a backend proxy for production
